# AJAX-API-
Uses forms, AJAX, and APIs to GET and POST data.

Form 1 will use the openweathermap API to GET the current weather for whichever city or zip code the user enters. Either a city OR a zip code (along with a country code [ie. US, CA]) can be used. Both are not needed.

Form 2 uses httpbin.org/post along with a POST request to prove that whatever data was entered by the user would successfully reach a server. The information entered will be displayed below the text input field.
